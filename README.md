---

### b. JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

**INNER JOIN: Sales by Region and Manager**
```sql
SELECT o.region, r.manager, SUM(o.sales) AS total_sales
FROM superstore_orders o
INNER JOIN region_manager r ON TRIM(o.region) = TRIM(r.region)
GROUP BY o.region, r.manager;
```

---

**LEFT JOIN: Show all managers even if no orders**
```sql
SELECT r.region, r.manager, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM region_manager r
LEFT JOIN superstore_orders o ON TRIM(r.region) = TRIM(o.region)
GROUP BY r.region, r.manager;
```

---

**RIGHT JOIN: Similar to LEFT JOIN with reversed roles**
```sql
SELECT r.region, r.manager, SUM(o.sales) AS total_sales
FROM superstore_orders o
RIGHT JOIN region_manager r ON TRIM(o.region) = TRIM(r.region)
GROUP BY r.region, r.manager;
```

---

### c. Subqueries

**Top customer by sales**
```sql
SELECT customer_name, total_sales
FROM (
  SELECT customer_name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM superstore_orders
  GROUP BY customer_name
) AS customer_sales
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

### d. Aggregate Functions

```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
  AVG(profit) AS avg_profit,
  MAX(discount) AS max_discount,
  MIN(sales) AS min_sale
FROM superstore_orders;
```

---

### e. Views

**Create monthly sales view**
```sql
CREATE VIEW monthly_sales AS
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
       SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
FROM superstore_orders
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
SELECT * FROM monthly_sales;
```

---

### f. Index Optimization

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_state ON superstore_orders(state);
CREATE INDEX idx_region ON superstore_orders(region);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON superstore_orders(order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON superstore_orders(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON superstore_orders(product_name);
```
